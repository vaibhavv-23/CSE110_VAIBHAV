  The ‘WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM’

  Effective waste management involves methods such as curbside collection, recycling centers, and composting to reduce environmental impact. Additionally, responsible disposal through hazardous waste collection and minimizing landfill use promotes sustainable practices. Encouraging buyer responsibility in choosing eco-friendly products further contributes to effective waste management.

          <h1>Case Study: Kamikatsu, Japan - Zero Waste Town</h1>

  <h2>Approach:</h2>
  <p>Kamikatsu adopted a unique and ambitious zero-waste initiative to eliminate the need for landfills.</p>

  <h2>Key Features:</h2>
  <ol>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Waste Sorting:</strong> Residents meticulously sort waste into 45 categories, including items like plastic, glass, paper, and even specific types of food waste.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> The town actively involves its residents in the waste management process, fostering a sense of responsibility and environmental awareness.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Reuse Center:</strong> Kamikatsu established a "Reuse Center" where residents can leave items they no longer need but are still in usable condition. Others can then take these items for free.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Composting:</strong> Organic waste is composted, and the resulting compost is used in local agriculture.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Impact:</h2>
  <p>Kamikatsu has made significant progress toward its zero-waste goal, achieving a remarkable waste diversion rate. The town serves as a model for sustainable waste management, emphasizing the importance of community participation, effective sorting systems, and a commitment to reducing overall waste generation.</p>

            <h5>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Curbside Collection:</strong> Most common in urban areas, where residents place their sorted waste bins at the curb for municipal collection services to pick up regularly.</li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>Recycling Centers:</strong> Community drop-off points where residents can take recyclables like paper, plastic, glass, and metal for proper recycling.</li>
              <br><li><strong>Buyer Responsibility:</strong> Encouraging responsible purchasing by choosing products with minimal packaging and those made from recyclable materials.</li>
          </ol>

        <h2>Household Waste Categories:</h2>
    <h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Recyclables:</strong> Materials like paper, cardboard, glass, metal, and certain plastics that can be recycled.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Organic Waste:</strong> Food scraps, garden waste, and other biodegradable materials suitable for composting.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Non-Recyclable Waste:</strong> Items that cannot be recycled, such as some plastics, certain packaging materials, and contaminated items.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Hazardous Waste:</strong> Products like batteries, paint, electronic waste, and chemicals that require special disposal methods due to their potential environmental or health risks.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>E-Waste:</strong> Electronic devices and components that should be recycled separately to recover valuable materials and prevent environmental harm.</li>

                      However, not all hospitals are following the guidelines mainly because of the lack of budget, 
                      lack of orientation regarding medical waste management to waste handlers, and flimsy monitoring from the government.
                     Segregation of medical waste is a vital part of hospital waste management. Poor management of hospital waste poses 
                     risk not only to its handlers during its treatment and disposal but also to the environment 
                     if not disposed in a proper manner. Haphazard management of hospital waste also gives black marketers an opportunity
                      to collect the disposed medical equipment and resell them.                     </p>

                       “We used to have an ideal waste management system to sterilize and dispose hospital waste before the 2015 earthquake. But the earthquake damaged the building where we had installed the autoclave device and now we don’t have any space. The new building is currently being used to accommodate admitted patients.”

                      Dr Century added that lack of space has barred the hospital from following NHRC’s National Health Care Waste Management Guidelines and they are relying on traditional means of sterilization for the time being.
                      
                      Management of medical waste at private hospitals is poorer as compared to government run hospitals for want of regular monitoring from authorities concerned. A report published by the Ministry of Health and Population shows that private hospitals continue to burn, bury and dispose hazardous immunization waste mixing it up with the municipal waste.                    </p>

                  1. Dry waste-                  
                  Store it in a bag in the utility area after cleaning and drying till it is picked up. No food residue must be left in the bottles and packets. Clean them as you would to reuse them. If clothes are totally unusable, or very damaged, they are categorized as dry waste. If clothes are soiled with body fluids, they become sanitary waste. If they are soiled with paint, or any chemicals, they are HHW (household hazardous waste).
                  
                  <br><br> 2. E-waste-                  
                  Store them in separate container which is kept closed, away from moisture and in which nothing else is put.                </p>

                  <br><br>
                  2 Compost your wet waste at the community level-
                  
                  If you live in a large apartment building, a community composting system like tank composting could be set up for all the wet waste from the residents. If not, the wet waste can be given out every day to your Municipality collection system.
                  <br><br>
                  3 Biomedical waste has to be wrapped separately in a newspaper and handed over to the municipality waste collection system. Expired medicines and injections, used syringes also have to be disposed in the same manner.
                  
                  Paint and other hazardous waste like cosmetics, mosquito repellents, tube lights etc have to be stored separately and handed over to the Municipal collection system.
